# Symptom-to-Diagnosis-Probabilistic-Engine
This project implements a Bayesian probabilistic engine in R that estimates the likelihood of different diseases given a set of reported symptoms. Rather than producing a single diagnosis, the model outputs a ranked probability distribution, reflecting uncertainty in real-world clinical reasoning.  
The goal is to demonstrate statistical thinking, probabilistic modeling, and clear communication of uncertainty—core skills required for data science roles in healthcare.

📊 Key Features
1.Accepts multiple symptoms as input
2.Outputs ranked disease probabilities instead of hard predictions
3.Highlights which symptoms contribute most to each disease likelihood
4.Designed with ethical considerations and uncertainty awareness

This project is for educational purposes only.
It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
All results should be interpreted as probabilistic simulations, not clinical decisions.
